---
layout: post
title: Paper Accepted at ICASSP 2025

  description: "Photos from lab events and celebrations"
```

#### Adding Photos

2. Add images numbered sequentially: `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, etc.

---

## 🖼️ Adding Images

### Image Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Profile photos | `assets/img/people/[category]/` |
| Funder logos | `assets/img/funders/` |
| Award photos | `assets/img/recognition/` |
| Album photos | `assets/img/album/[category]/` |
| Project images | `assets/img/projects/` |
| Research highlights | `assets/img/research-highlights/` |
| Logos | `assets/img/logo/` |

### Image Guidelines

- **Profile photos:** Square aspect ratio, minimum 400x400px
- **Logos:** PNG with transparent background preferred
- **General images:** JPG or PNG, reasonable file size (< 500KB)
- **Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, WebP, SVG

### Automatic Processing

The site uses ImageMagick to automatically generate responsive image sizes (480px, 800px, 1400px widths) during build.

---

## 🌙 Dark Mode Support

The site supports automatic dark/light mode switching. When adding content:

1. **Logos with dark backgrounds:** Set `invert: true` in `funding.yml`
2. **Custom images:** Use CSS variables for colors that need to adapt
3. **Bootstrap classes:** The site overrides `.bg-light`, `.text-dark`, etc. for dark mode

---

## 🛠️ Development

### File Formatting

Format Liquid/HTML/Markdown files:

```bash
npx prettier --plugin=@shopify/prettier-plugin-liquid --write "**/*.{liquid,md,html}"
```

### Building for Production

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

The built site will be in `_site/`.

### Key Configuration

Main configuration is in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
title: Spectrum Lab
email: css@iisc.ac.in
url: "https://spectrum-lab-iisc.github.io"
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. Make changes locally
2. Test with local server
3. Commit and push to `main`
4. GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
5. Changes appear at https://spectrum-lab-iisc.github.io within minutes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with SCSS error:**
- Check for syntax errors in `_sass/` files
- Ensure all variables are defined

**Images not showing:**
- Verify file path matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check file exists in the correct location
- For responsive images, ensure ImageMagick is installed

**Person not appearing:**
- Ensure `show: true` in front matter
- Check file is in correct category folder
- Verify YAML syntax is correct

**Publications not showing:**
- Validate BibTeX syntax
- Ensure required fields are present
- Check for special characters that need escaping

### Validating Changes

```bash
# Build and check for errors
bundle exec jekyll build --verbose

# Serve and check console for errors
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --port 8080
```
