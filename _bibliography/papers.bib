  abstract = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized novel view synthesis by offering excellent visual quality, real-time rendering and faster training. However, the infinite support and inherent smoothness of Gaussian kernels limit their ability to reconstruct fine geometric details and high-frequency texture, while also introducing domain-clipping artifacts near scene boundaries. We introduce SplineSplat, a novel approach that replaces Gaussian kernels with compactly supported and scalable polynomial B-spline bases, specifically, linear, quadratic, and cubic splines. B-Splines offer improved spatial localization, greater representational flexibility, and efficient evaluation through piecewise-polynomial definitions. We utilize fast spline computation strategies that enable significant training acceleration without sacrificing rendering quality or speed. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 static dataset and NVIDIA dynamic dataset demonstrate that SplineSplat matches the reconstruction fidelity of 3DGS while reducing training time by up to 18\%, making it an effective kernel for high-performance radiance-field representations.},
